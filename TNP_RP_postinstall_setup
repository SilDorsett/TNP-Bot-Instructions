### [p] is your Prefix! For TNP usage, it is recommended to use both ~ and ! as prefixes. I use ++ for preparing a new bot while the old one is running and do a prefix swap later.

######### (Big Custom Command) #########

[p]cc create intro "TNP RP occurs on the TNP Forums or RMB. Each platform has its own settings. You can be in any you like, or as many as you like. 

The main Forum setting is called Eras. It's your standard Modern Tech (MT) RP setting.

The main RMB setting is called Strangereal, or SR. It, like Eras, is a MT setting but the two approach things differently. 

Eras is a bit slower paced, and tries to keep things as realistic as possible, while SR has a speedier pace and more freedom in what you can do with tech.  In Eras tech is at a modern level with tech that will be viable in 5-10 years also allowed. In SR you can have future tech, magic, medieval tech, whatever. 

Eras is more collaborative and worldbuilding, SR is more freeform. 

The other settings on the Forum are Inaius, a sci fi space RP. Imperium Galactica, a sci fi space RP that's based on feuding royal houses in a galactic empire, Asheron, a post-apocalyptic setting on Earth, and Sorras, the high fantasy setting.

The other setting on the RMB is Aetherea. Which has a more steampunky vibe."
